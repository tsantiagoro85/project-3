# Project-3

## Description

### In this project, we utilized Excel, Python, R/RStudio, Seaborn, Javascript, HTML, Plotly, and SQL in order to analyze the correlation between Education level and Poverty rate among US states. We applied Excel, Python and R in order to select and curate our data. This gave us a clearer understanding of the information we were working with before plotting the data. For plotting the data, we utilized the Python library Seaborn, creating pair grids, barplots, and correlation plots to pvisurovide further understanding to our dataset. Lastly, we created interactive visualizations to better display data on a state by state level. We did so through the use of Javascript and HTML, as well as Plotly. In order to create the Database, we used SQL.

## Ethics

### We used data from the US census, which provides publicly available demographic and socio-economic data to support research, as well as other beneficial uses. We made sure to respect these guidelines throughout our work.

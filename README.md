# Project-3: Education & Income: Is there a Correlation?
Group 1 (Houston): Tasha Santiago, Wisdom Mbaluka, Agustin Rodriguez, Alfred Savio & Connor Chadwick

## Project Description
### The present project aimed to explore two datasets downloaded from https://data.census.gov. The first dataset contains the raw population counts binned by education level, sex and age category across the USA, including all 50 states, districts (Washington D.C.)and territories (Puerto Rico). The second dataset contains the raw and percentage values for various income levels across all 50 states, districts (Washington D.C.)and territories (Puerto Rico). Percentage values were converted to raw values by multiplying percentages by total households, family households, married families households or non-family households, as needed, and dividing the results by 100. In addition, education level was correlated with poverty threshold.

The education datasets were downloaded for 2018-2023, and can be found in the following link: https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B15001?q=state%20population%20by%20education&tp=false

## Project Methods Overview
### We utilized a combination of Excel, and languages such as Python, R/RStudio, JavaScript, HTML and SQL, and libraries including  Seaborn, Plotly and D3 in order to curate, manipulate and analyze the mentioned datasets, and determine if there is a  correlation between education level and poverty rate across the USA. See the flowchart below:

## Ethical Considerations
### We used data from the US census, which provides publicly available demographic and socio-economic data to support research, as well as other beneficial uses. We made sure to respect these guidelines throughout our work.
